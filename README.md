In hyperspectral image (HSI) classification, deep learning techniques have significantly advanced performance, yet challenges such as inadequate spatial-spectral feature extraction, high computational complexity, and inefficient multi-scale feature integration persist.  To address these issues, we propose CFINet, a novel channel-enhanced feature integration network comprising three key modules: the spatial dual attention module (SDAM), the channel-enhanced cross-attention module (CECAM), and the multi-scale feature integration module (MSFIM).  SDAM enhances spatial information interactions, CECAM captures inter-channel relationships, and MSFIM integrates features across multiple scales.  Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that CFINet significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art methods, achieving overall accuracies of 99.91%, 99.97%, 99.91%, and 99.90% on the Pavia University, Botswana, WHU-Hi-HanChuan, and WHU-Hi-HongHu datasets, respectively.  This study highlights the effectiveness of hierarchical attention-driven feature integration in advancing HSI classification.
